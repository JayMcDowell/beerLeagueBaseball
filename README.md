This is our Beer League Baseball project.  Chris Jones and Jay McDowell.  

Project Status

Phase One:
We set up our page using Bootstrap and paired it with Backlift.com to establish a database.  
Teams are able to be added and there is a "delete team" option.  The modal form collects the pertinent data.  We used Bootstrap Popover to create the "hover" feature that shows each team's information.  We were not able to establish a minimum or maximum team limit.  

Phase Two:
We used the predefined schedule and added a "start season" button to generate the games.  Each game's score can be updated and that information is stored in the database.  The wins and losses are reflected in the standings.  We used bubble sort to sort the teams by winning percentage.

 The index.html contains our markup.  The functions.js contains our javascript.  The beerleagueBaseball.css contains our style.
